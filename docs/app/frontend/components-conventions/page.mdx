# Components Conventions

In this section, we will cover the conventions for creating components in the application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Make sure you know about [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/).
> You should avoid using raw HTML elements and use Material UI components instead.

## Component Structure

Components should be organized in a way that makes them easy to find and maintain.

Components can be placed in two main directories:
- `/components` - for components that are used across the application.
    Also, here can be complex components that are used in a specific page.
- `/features/{feature}/components` - for components that are specific to a feature.
    If component is used multiple times in nested routes, it should be placed in `/components`.

## Naming Conventions

Such as any React components, custom components should be named using PascalCase, which means that the first letter of each word is capitalized.

## Component Types

Components can be divided into three main types:
- **Simple Components** - components that are self-contained and do not have any subcomponents.
- **Complex Components** - components that have multiple subcomponents or hooks.
- **Group Components** - components that group multiple subcomponents together.

### Simple Components

For example, a component that displays a button should be named `MyButton`.

```tsx filename="/components/MyButton.tsx"
import { Button } from "@mui/material";

export const MyButton = () => {
    return <Button variant="contained">Click me</Button>;
};
```

### Complex Components

If your component is complex and has multiple subcomponents,
you can create a directory for it and place the main component file inside it.

Nested logic should be places to corresponding directories, such as in features.

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name={"components"} defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name={"MyComplexComponent"} defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name={"components"} defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name={"MySubComponent.tsx"} />
                <FileTree.File name={"MyOtherSubComponent.tsx"} />
            </FileTree.Folder>
            <FileTree.Folder name={"hooks"} defaultOpen>
                <FileTree.File name={"useMyHook.ts"} />
            </FileTree.Folder>
            <FileTree.File name={"index.tsx"} />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The main component file should be named `index.tsx` to make it easier to import.

```tsx filename="/components/MyComplexComponent/index.tsx"
import { MySubComponent } from "@/components/MyComplexComponent/components/MySubComponent";
import { MyOtherSubComponent } from "@/components/MyComplexComponent/components/MyOtherSubComponent";
import { Box } from "@mui/material";

export const MyComplexComponent = () => (
    <Box>
        <MySubComponent />
        <MyOtherSubComponent />
    </Box>
);
```

### Grouping Subcomponents

Or if you want to Group all subcomponents in one file, you can do it like this:

```tsx filename="/components/MyComplexComponent/index.tsx"

import { MySubComponent } from "@/components/MyComplexComponent/MySubComponent";
import { MyOtherSubComponent } from "@/components/MyComplexComponent/MyOtherSubComponent";

export const MyComplexComponent = {
    MySubComponent,
    MyOtherSubComponent,
};
```

Then you can use it like this:

```tsx filename="/features/some-page/SomeFeature.tsx"

import { MyComplexComponent } from "@/components/MyComplexComponent";
import { Box } from "@mui/material";

export const SomeFeature = () => (
    <Box>
        <MyComplexComponent.MySubComponent />
        <MyComplexComponent.MyOtherSubComponent />
    </Box>
);
```
