# Tests Conventions

In this section you will find the conventions we follow when writing tests in our application.
These conventions help maintain consistency and readability across the codebase.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This article is about automated tests, not about psychological tests.

Testing frontend part is going with the following tools:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - a JavaScript testing framework.
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - a library for testing React components.

## Test file location

Test files should be located in the same directory as the component or module they are testing.
Also, it should have the same name as the file being tested, with a `.test.js` suffix.

For example, if you have a component file named `Button.tsx`,
the corresponding test file should be named `Button.test.tsx` and located in the same directory.

## Test structure

Each test file should follow a consistent structure to improve readability and maintainability.

A typical test file should include the following sections:

1. **Imports**: Import the necessary libraries, components, and utilities.
    It is important to import `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
2. **Setup**: Set up any required configurations, mocks, or initial states.
3. **Tests**: Define the individual test cases using `describe` and `it` blocks.

## Creating a new test

When creating a new test, follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Add imports

Start by importing the necessary libraries and components you will be testing.
You need to import `@testing-library/react` for rendering components
 and `@testing-library/jest-dom` for additional matchers.

You can import a component you are testing using a relative path.
It is acceptable because the test file is located in the same directory as the component.

```tsx filename="ResultsDialog.test.tsx"
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
import ResultsDialog from "./ResultsDialog";
import TestResult from "@/schemas/TestResult";
import TestBase from "@/schemas/TestBase";
```

### Mock components

If the component you are testing relies on other components or data,
you may need to mock those components or data to isolate the test.

You can use `jest.mock` to create mock implementations of components or modules.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can disable specific ESLint rules for the mocked components if necessary.
> But don't forget you shouldn't disable rules outside of test files.

```tsx filename="ResultsDialog.test.tsx"
/* eslint-disable react/display-name */

jest.mock(
    "@/components/ResultsDialog/components/ResultsTitle",
    () => ({test}: {test: TestBase}) => (
        <div data-testid="results-title">{test.name}</div>
    )
);

const mockTest: TestResult = {
    id: "result-1",
    patient_id: "patient-1",
    test: { id: "test-1", name: "Test Name", type: "raven" },
    results: { _: [] },
    verdict: null,
    passed_at: "2024-06-01T12:00:00Z"
};
```

### Write tests

Now you can write your test cases using `describe` and `it` blocks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Each test case should be focused on a specific behavior or functionality of the component.
> - Names of the test cases should be descriptive and indicate what is being tested.
> - And don't forget to split your test by lines according to "GIVEN-WHEN-THEN" principle.

```tsx filename="ResultsDialog.test.tsx"
describe("ResultsDialog", () => {
    it("renders show results button", () => {
        render(<ResultsDialog test={mockTest} />);

        expect(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Показати результати" })).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

    it("opens dialog and renders title and content on button click", () => {
        render(<ResultsDialog test={mockTest} />);

        fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Показати результати" }));

        expect(screen.getByTestId("results-title")).toHaveTextContent("Test Name");
        expect(screen.getByTestId("results-content")).toHaveTextContent("result-1");
    });

    it("handles missing test name gracefully", () => {
        render(<ResultsDialog test={{ ...mockTest, test: { ...mockTest.test, name: "" } }} />);

        fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Показати результати" }));

        expect(screen.getByTestId("results-title")).toHaveTextContent("");
    });
})
```
