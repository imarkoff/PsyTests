# Getting Started

Hello and welcome to the guide on how to get started with the __PsyTests__ frontend project!
This guide will walk you through the process of initializing the project and understanding the structure.

## Initial Setup

<Steps>
### Clone the Repository

To get started, you need to clone the repository and go to the frontend directory.

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/imarkoff/PsyTests.git
cd PsyTests
cd frontend
```

### Install Dependencies

Right after that, you can install the dependencies using npm:

```bash copy
npm install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.

### Start the Development Server

Run the development server using:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```
</Steps>


## Project Structure

- `app` - contains route handlers and pages of the application.
- `components` - contains reusable components used in the application.
- `features` - contains logic for pages and components that are specific to a page.
- `hooks` - contains custom hooks used in the application.
- `lib` - contains the core logic of the application, including services, controllers, and utility functions.
See the [Understanding the `lib` structure](./frontend/managing-requests/lib-structure) article for more details.
- `schemas` - contains TypeScript schemas for data validation and type safety.
- `theme` - defines Material UI theme context and styles for the application.
- `utils` - contains utility functions used in the application.
- `middleware.ts` - handles redirects and authentication checks.



## Dealing with imports

When working with imports in the project, you should use absolute imports instead of relative ones.
This means you can import modules directly from the root of the project without using `../` to navigate through directories.
Here is an example of how to import a module:

```ts
import { MyComponent } from "@/components/MyComponent";
```

This approach makes the code cleaner and easier to read, especially in larger projects where relative paths can become cumbersome.
