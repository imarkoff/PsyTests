# Using HTTPS for Local Development

When developing applications locally, you might want to use HTTPS
to ensure that your application behaves similarly to how it would in production.
This guide will help you set up HTTPS for local development.

## Generating SSL Certificates in the `certs` Directory

To use HTTPS, you need to generate SSL certificates. You can use tools like OpenSSL to create self-signed certificates.

Interactive generation:
```bash copy
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/fullchain.key -out certs/privkey.crt
```

Quiet generation:
```bash copy
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/fullchain.key -out certs/privkey.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"
```

## Using HTTPS in Docker

After generating the certificates, you need to rebuild your Docker containers to apply the changes.

```bash copy
docker-compose up --build
```

## Using HTTPS on the backend

If you want to use HTTPS on th backend out of the box,
you can use the `uvicorn` command with the `--ssl-keyfile` and `--ssl-certfile` options.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Path to the certificates must be absolute path.

```bash copy
python -m uvicorn app.main:app
    --reload --port 8000
    --ssl-keyfile /home/imarkoff/Projects/PsyTests/certs/privkey.pem
    --ssl-certfile /home/imarkoff/Projects/PsyTests/certs/fullchain.pem
```

## Using HTTPS on the frontend

On frontend, you can use the `next dev` command with the `--experimantal` option.
Already enabled by default in `package.json`.

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you are getting the following error:
>
> ```
> self-signed certificate; if the root CA is installed locally, try running Node.js with --use-system-ca
> ```
>
> You can try to run the command with the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` environment variable.
> Some IDEs allow you to set environment variables for the run configuration.
