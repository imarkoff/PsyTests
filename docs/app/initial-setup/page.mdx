# Initial setup

Hello and welcome to the initial setup guide for the app!
This guide will help you get started with the app and configure it to your needs.

## Installation

To install the app, you need to have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.

<Steps>
### Clone the repository

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/imarkoff/PsyTests.git
cd PsyTests
```

### Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure it

```bash copy
cp .env.example .env
```

### Fill `.env` in `frontend/` directory

Frontend has its own `.env` file.
You need to do the same as you did in the previous step.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you want to run frontend in Docker, you need to replace `localhost` with `backend` in the `.env` file.
>
> ```env copy
> API_URL=http://backend:8000/api
> ```

### Build Docker images

```bash copy
docker-compose build
```

### Start the app

```bash copy
docker-compose up -d
```

Building full app may take some time, so I recommend to build only backend image.

```bash copy
docker-compose up -d backend
```

If `docker-compose` does not work, you can try to run the following command:

```bash copy
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -p psytests up --build -d
```
